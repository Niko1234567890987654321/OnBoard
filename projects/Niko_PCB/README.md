<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board has pictures of cool things that I like, (George Harrison, an axolotl, and Neo from the Matrix). It says NEO on it because that's my initials.
You can tap your phone to it and it will open up a link to a cool video.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$2.00
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
